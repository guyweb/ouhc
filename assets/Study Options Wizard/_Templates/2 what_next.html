<h2>Stopping studying your module</h2>
<p>If your module has not yet started, or you are paying with a tuition fee loan and within 14 days of the module start date you can <a href="http://local.www2.open.ac.uk/students/help/cancelling-your-module">cancel your module</a> with no fee liability.</p>
<p>If you have started studying your module you can defer and return to the module later if you wish to. Before you do this it is worth exploring whether you can continue - depending on the reason you need to defer there may be help we can offer so you don't have to stop.</p>
