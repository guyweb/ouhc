<h2>Apply to claim a qualification</h2>
<p>As well as BA (Hons) and BSc (Hons) degrees, we also offer Certificates of Higher Education (CertHE) and Diplomas of Higher Education (DipHE), which require fewer module credits to complete.</p>
<p>When you apply to claim a qualification, we will check to see if you are eligible for any of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Certificate of Higher Education (CertHE) if you have 120 credits at the correct level of study</li>
<li>Diploma of Higher Education (DipHE) if you have 240 credits at the correct level of study</li>
<li>CertHE Open or DipHE Open, which cover a range of subject areas and could be counted towards a variety of qualifications in the future</li>
<li>Certain subject-specific CertHEs and DipHEs</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also find this useful to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>CertHEs and DipHEs are recognised qualifications in their own right</li>
<li>If you return to study in the future, at the OU or elsewhere, you may be able to count them as stage one (CertHE) or stage one and two (DipHE) of an honours degree. This is however dependent on the curriculm requirements and restructions around age of credit for that qualification</li>
<li>Under current funding regulations in England, you may not be able to apply for funding such as a tuition fee loan if you decide to study another qualification at the same level, for example starting another honours degree from stage one, if you have already received a CertHE or DipHE</li>
</ul>

<p>Clicking 'Apply to claim a qualification' will submit an application for your completed credit to be assessed for a qualification.</p>
