<h2>What is your situation?</h2>
<p style="color: red;"><em>--- Is this the right text for here? Do we not ask the student what they want, then explain the specific option once they've clicked it? ---</em></p>
<p>If you need to stop studying right now you will need to cancel or defer from your current module.</p>
<p>If you can continue studying now but don't think you're going to be able to study in the next academic year you can request a study break. This means we'll know you're not studying so will communicate with you appropriately but you'll keep your registration on your qualification so won't lose access to university services.</p>
<p>If you're not sure whether to study, check what <a href="#">modules you can enrol on now</a>.</p>      <div class="wizard">
